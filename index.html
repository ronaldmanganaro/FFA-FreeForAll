          <p class="noTab">Before you play please make sure to check out the known issues under the demo. This will help circumvent any issues that you may have trying out the demo.
		  Unfortunately, there are a lot of issues in the demo that are not issues with the actual build. This is a quick port just to show off some of the games features. I will not
		  be fixing any small issues, however if someone comes upon a game breaking issue I will fix it as soon as possible. You can always reach me at ronaldmanganaro@gmail.com. I hope
		  you have fun playing :).</p>

          This game was originally developed with the Wii U Nintendo console in mind as the target platform. Due to time constraints upadates to the game
		  are slow.
